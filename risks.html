        <p class="risk_content">Fifty percent of smokers die of a smoking-related disease, and the life expectancy of
            one in four smokers is reduced by as much as 15-20 years.
            Before the advent of widespread tobacco use in World War II, lung cancer was rare. So rare, in fact, that
            doctors were required to report cases of lung cancer to the federal government to help identify the local
            environmental cause of the condition among an affected population, much like reporting cases of mesothelioma
            today.

            While most people recognize that smoking is highly destructive for their lungs, many have yet to come to
            terms with how smoking affects the rest of the body. Damage to one's skin, mouth, hands, feet, respiratory
            system, heart, bones, and reproductive system becomes readily evident in long-time smokers
            <br> <br>Areas of the body damaged by smoking include: <br> <br>

            <br>Smoking can increase the likelihood of having a stroke by 2 ~ 4 times. Strokes can cause brain damage
            and death.One way that stroke can cause brain injury is through a brain aneurysm, which occurs when the wall
            of a blood vessel weakens and creates a bulge. This bulge can burst and cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage,
            which can lead to a stroke.

        <div class="rsk_description">The lungs are perhaps the most obvious organ that smoking affects.
            It often takes many years before a person notices any symptoms of smoking-related lung disease. This means
            that people may not receive a diagnosis until the disease is quite advanced.
            Smoking can impact the lungs in several ways. The primary reason is that smoking damages the airways and air
            sacs — known as alveoli — in the lungs.
            Three of the most common smoking-related lung conditions in the U.S. are:<br> <br>
            <li class="rsk_description"><b>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</b>. COPD is a long-term
                disease. It causes wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. COPD is the third leading cause
                of death in the U.S.</li>
            <li class="rsk_description"><b>Chronic bronchitis</b>. Chronic bronchitis occurs when the airways produce
                too much mucus. This leads to a long-lasting cough and inflamed airways. Over time, scar tissue and
                mucus can completely block the airways and cause infection.</li>
            <li class="rsk_description"><b>Emphysema</b>. Emphysema is a type of COPD that reduces the number of alveoli
                and breaks down the walls between them. This makes it difficult to breathe, even at rest, and over time,
                a person may need an oxygen mask.</li>
            <br> <br>Other lung diseases caused by smoking include pneumonia, asthma, and tuberculosis.

        <img class="riskpic" src="bone.png" alt="Bones">
        <div class="rsk_description">According to the <a class="rsk_description"
                href="https://www.bones.nih.gov/health-info/bone/osteoporosis/conditions-behaviors/bone-smoking">Institutes
                of Health (NIH)</a>, smoking reduces bone density, making the bones weaker and more brittle. Smoking can
            also impair bone healing after a fracture.

            Researchers find it difficult to say whether this is a direct effect of smoking, or due to other risk
            factors prevalent in people who smoke. These include lower body weight and doing less physical exercise.

            This may affect females more than males. Females are more prone to osteoporosis and broken bones.

            Quitting smoking, even later in life, can help limit bone loss linked with smoking.

        <div class="rsk_description"><br>Chemicals in tobacco smoke increase the chance of heart problems and
            cardiovascular diseases.
            Smoking causes atherosclerosis, which is when plaque builds up in the blood and sticks to the artery walls.
            This makes them narrower, reducing blood flow and increasing the risk of blood clots.<br>
            Smoking also damages the blood vessels, making them thicker and narrower. This makes it harder for blood to
            flow, and also increases blood pressure and heart rate.<br>
            Smoking has links with the following cardiovascular conditions:<br> <br>
            <li class="rsk_description">coronary heart disease, one of the leading causes of death</li>
            <li class="rsk_description">a heart attack, as smoking doubles the risk of heart attack</li>
            <li class="rsk_description">blockages that reduce blood flow to the skin and legs</li>

            Smoking can have several effects on oral health and may cause:<br> <br>
            <li class="rsk_description">Halitosis, or bad breath</li>
            <li class="rsk_description">stained teeth</li>

            <li class="rsk_description">reduced sense of taste</li>
            <br> <br>Smoking irritates the gum tissues. The American Dental Association (ADA) state that smoking
            increases the risk of gum disease, which can add to halitosis.

        <div class="rsk_description">Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen that can reach the skin. This speeds up the
            aging process and can make skin appear dull or gray.<br> <br>
            Smoking can cause:
            <li class="rsk_description">facial wrinkles, especially around the lips</li>
            <li class="rsk_description">baggy eyelids</li>
            <li class="rsk_description">uneven skin coloring, such as a yellow or gray tone</li>
            <li class="rsk_description">dry, coarse skin</li>
            <li class="rsk_description">temporary yellowing of the fingers and fingernails</li>
            <br> <br>Smoking reduces how quickly skin wounds heal, increases the risk of skin infections, and increases
            the severity of skin conditions, including psoriasis.
